        <h1>Vision Statement</h1>
        <p>
            This is a site for prospective college students who want to be able to search for colleges based on set criteria and see if both the college, and its city, are
            right for them. The College Companion is an information system that will allow the user to fill out a form of set criteria, hold a search based on
            that criteria and get back a list of results with the best match on top. They can then look over various details of these results, such as information
            about the city amenities, travel options or demographics. Unlike the current websites, such as Naviance Student or ACT College Search,
            the focus is on the social, economic and psychological needs of the student being met – not their test scores.
        </p>

        </ul>
